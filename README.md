I am building a CNC machine and needed a pen holder to do some testing. This is the result, it worked very well and is so easy. Its designed to work with the new Sharpie fine point pen, but you could make it work with most any pen that has a round barrel. In the picture you can see its plotting out a PCB board.



Instructions
To make this holder you don't need much some acrylic, 2 o-rings that fit around your pen barrel, and a spring. Use the two o-rings to control the amount of movement of the pen. The spring can be what ever you have laying around you do not need much pressure, so don't get carried away. Glue the parts together with some acrylic glue, let it dry and try it out.

All dimensions are very precisely set in the file; the top collar fits very very tightly and stays even without the screw and the bottom collars slide freely but without any play on the shaft. The screw holes all have 8-32 thread realized and manually adjusted for exact fit.
The hole fits the standard sharpie and the double sided sharpies.
I'll post more pics of it actually working on the CNC.
